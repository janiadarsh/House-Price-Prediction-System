# House-Price-Prediction-System
This project is a House Price Prediction System that utilizes machine learning to predict the prices of residential properties based on various input factors such as area, number of rooms, property type, and age. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000+ records and achieves an accuracy of 87%. The system includes a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions and processes over 1,000 user inputs daily.

This project employs machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to predict the value of residential properties based on various features. The system is trained on historical data, utilizing features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, among others, to estimate property prices.

# Key Concepts:

Machine Learning Algorithms: These are used to analyze historical data and identify patterns in property features and corresponding prices.

Linear Regression: A statistical method employed to model the relationship between the property's features (independent variables) and its price (dependent variable). The algorithm derives a linear equation to predict property prices accurately.
